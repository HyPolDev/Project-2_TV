## 🎓 Special Thanks

- To **Geekshubs Academy** for the trust and encouragement to develop this first project (1/12 i suppose).
- To **Spruce Gabriela** for the Snake code source that was adapted: [Repository](https://github.com/SpruceGabriela/snake-the-game)

## 📄 Add Ons - Bugs and Dreams

Project finished on a polishing state, it is posible to find bugs, probably with the snake game:
- JS needs to be refactorized, the design is fully functional but not optimized
    - SnakeGame is always on and just z-indexed up or down
    - Clear screan should have its own function
- JS also may be splited in two different scripts
- Pxs were used as size unit, due to my incompetence. Won't happen again
<br>
I'm no graphic designer to this date however I still belive the styling of this TV can be perfected with minimal changes, and I encourarge you to perform them.
