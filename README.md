## 📄 Add Ons - Bugs and Dreams

Project finished on a polishing state, it is posible to find bugs, probably with the snake game:
-  ***Major bug I havent been able to solve: Volume display lights apear and work fine only in local versions of the project***, not in GitHub Pages. Till this date i havent figured out why: routes are fine and f12(inspect element) shows no sign of anithing being broken : images are where they shoud... Is it maybe something to do with GitHub? I have no idea.
- JS needs to be refactorized, the design is fully functional but not optimized:
    - SnakeGame is always on and just visibility changed.
    - "Clear screan" should have its own function.
- JS also may be splited in two different scripts.
- Pxs were used as size unit, due to my incompetence. Won't happen again.

I'm no graphic designer to this date however I still belive the styling of this TV can be perfected with minimal changes, and I encourarge you to perform them.
